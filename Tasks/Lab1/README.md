# Lab 1 Introduction to C Programming
This lab contains **9 basic programming tasks** written in C
**- C program structure (`main`, `#include`)**
**- Input/output using `scanf` and `printf`**
**- Data types (`int`, `float`)**
**- Arithmetic operations**
**- Conditional logic using `if-else`**
**- Input validation**
